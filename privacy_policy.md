## What We Collect

*Account information.* To create an account, you must provide a username and
password. Your username is public, and it doesnâ€™t have to be related to your
real name.

*Information you provide.* The sole service of this application is to migrate
YouTube data, and so any data chosen to be migrated is also collected for no
more than a month. This is done to allow the data to be modified before
migration and to prevent progress loss or interruption.

The data accessed and stored from the YouTube API includes the following:

- The user's created playlists and their contents
- The user's liked videos list contents
- Playlists added to the user's library
- The user's Watch Later list contents
- The user's subscriptions list

Playlist data includes the following details:

- Playlist Title
- Playlist ID
- Playlist thumbnail image url
- Playlist owner (except for user's created playlists)
- Playlist videos data (only for user's created playlists)
- Playlist privacy status (only for user's created playlists, done to ensure
  privacy status is retained after migration)

Video data includes the following details:

- Video Title
- Video ID
- Video thumbnail image url
- Video owner's channel title

Subscriptions data includes the following details:

- Subscribed channel's ID

## How Your Data is Used

Account credentials are stored indefinitely, but can be deleted or modified by
the user.

Other information is automatically deleted at 14 days, can be deleted by the user,
and is deleted upon completing migration. This data is only used to interact
with the YouTube account the user is migrating to.

Users can revoke the access this app has to their data via the Google security
settings page of the following link.
